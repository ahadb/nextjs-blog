I haven't had much time to blog since 2020, abd I wanted to start afresh and build a blog from scratch so at it grows i could control each aspect. There are a myriad of options and it
can be a daunting task to choose the right platform for yourself. I went ahead with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as I was curious about the architecture - I'm happy to say It's been a 
pleasure to work with and in my short time I have nothing short of a great developer experience.

Noting a couple of things down quickly that I took to heart in the few hours it took me to get this blog working (...and deployed too!).

* Traditional approach brings me back to the old days, for example using `<Head></Head>` components and passing in script tags as props
* Get up and ready quickly in dev env. Tooling is available for you immediately, no need to have to configure Babel, Webpack, etc. (though one should know how they work under the hood)
* Pre-rendering, data-fetching, dynamic routes, SSG, SSR and all the goodies that come with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* Deployment was a breeze and able to move from dev to prod env without much hassle (on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/))

If you've been developing and renedering your components with only client-side architecture this is a great opportunity to see how things have evolved. 

Certainly and without a doubt front-end architecture is evolving into what we are calling Web 3.0.
