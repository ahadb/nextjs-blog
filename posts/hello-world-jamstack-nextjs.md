I haven't had much time to blog since 2020, but I've been spending some time creating a new blog with JamStack and NextJS. It's been a pleasure to work with! Noting a couple of things
I really liked while working with this new stack and framework:

* Traditional approach brings me back to the old days, for example using `<Head></Head>` components and passing in script tags as props
* Get up and ready quickly in dev env. Tooling is available for you immediately, no need to have to configure Babel, Webpack, etc. (though one should know how they work under the hood)
* Pre-rendering, data-fetching, dynamic routes, SSG, SSR and all the goodies that come with NextJS
* Deployment was a breeze and able to move from dev to prod env without much hassle (on Vercel)

If you've been developing with only client-side React architecture this is a good opportunity to see how things have evolved.
