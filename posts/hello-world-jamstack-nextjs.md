I haven't had much time to blog since 2020, and I wanted to start afresh and build a blog from scratch so at it grows i could control each aspect. There are a myriad of options and it
can be a daunting task to choose the right platform for yourself. I went ahead with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) as I was curious about the architecture - I'm happy to say It's been a 
pleasure to work with and in my short time I have nothing short of a great developer experience.

Other possibilities of course include, definitely check them out:

* [Remix](https://remix.run/)
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
* [Netifly](https://www.netlify.com/)

Noting a couple of things down quickly that I took to heart in the few hours it took me to get this blog working (...and deployed too!).

* Traditional web feel that was modernized in some aspects of the development flow took me back to the old days
* Get up and ready quickly in dev env. Tooling is available for you immediately, no need to have to configure Babel, Webpack, etc. (though one should know how they work under the hood)
* Pre-rendering, data-fetching, dynamic routes, SSG, SSR and all the goodies that come with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
* Scalability and high-performance in both dev and prod
* Fantastic developer experience (Fast reload, etc)
* Build, preview and deploy (I deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/))

If you've been developing and rendering your components with only client-side architecture take this as an opportunity to see how things have evolved.
